# Yuu's Trello Suite

[A chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yuus-trello-suite/hohjdflonljbnodmbbepaemjkajoaaed). 

Features include:
- Toggle visibility of lists. (Saved per board)
- Toggle a "compressed" view of the cards in the current board. (Saved per board)
- The "Show More Labels" button is automatically pressed when editing labels.

This extension is as simple as I could make it for what it does.
